Machine Learning &amp; Data Analysis

Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database was collected 
by Dr. William H. Wolberg, University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison. 

Warning: there will be no fancy visualizations. 
This project is purely 'machine learning focused'. Though there will be a 'rainbowed' ROC curve.

Full analysis and 'work flow' can be seen on: www.rpubs.com/elena_petrova/breastcancer

P.S. At the moment of publishing, the url with data was blocked, so I refer to self-generated data. 
Perhaps the original url will be still avalaible later on www.stat.yale.edu/~pollard/Courses/230.spring03/WBC/breastcancer.data
